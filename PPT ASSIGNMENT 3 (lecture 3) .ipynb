    "Interpret the results of the linear regression analysis, including the slope, intercept, and the coefficient of determination (R-squared).

    "To perform a simple linear regression to predict performance based on temperature, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Prepare the data.\n",
    "The data collected for temperature and performance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature (in degrees Celsius): [20, 22, 23, 19, 21]\n",
    "Performance (on a scale of 1 to 10): [8, 7, 9, 6, 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the data is properly aligned, meaning that the performance ratings correspond to the correct temperature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Plot the data.\n",
    "Create a scatter plot with temperature on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis. Each data point represents a temperature-performance pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the correlation coefficient.\n",
    "Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) to determine the strength and direction of the linear relationship between temperature and performance. You can use a statistical software or a programming language with appropriate libraries to calculate the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Perform linear regression analysis.\n",
    "Perform a linear regression analysis to determine the equation of the regression line that best fits the data. The equation is typically in the form of y = mx + b, where y represents the predicted performance, x represents the temperature, m represents the slope of the line, and b represents the y-intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use statistical software or programming languages with appropriate libraries to perform linear regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Interpret the results.\n",
    "Interpret the results of the linear regression analysis, including the slope, intercept, and the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The slope indicates how much the performance is expected to change for each unit change in temperature. The intercept represents the predicted performance when the temperature is zero. The R-squared value indicates the proportion of the variance in performance that can be explained by temperature.\n",
